#summary Using modman with git or other SCMs

= Introduction =

Using the `deploy` command bypasses any svn-specific functionality. As such, modman can be used with any SCM or no SCM at all.

== Git ==

Here is a suggestion for using modman with git. This example assumes you have a project with a proper modman file located at `<repository>`:

{{{
> modman init
> git clone <repository> .modman/mymodule
> cat > .modman/mymodule/.git/hooks/post-merge
#!/bin/bash
modman deploy
> chmod +x .modman/mymodule/.git/hooks/post-merge
}}}

Now, when you run `git pull` on this repository the `modman deploy` command will be run after a successful merge of any upstream changes.

== Others ==

Perhaps other SCMs can just as easily be integrated, let me know if you know how!
