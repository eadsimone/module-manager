#Running shell commands on update

= Shell Command =

Modman allows an update, checkout or deploy to invoke shell commands with the @shell operator.

Example:

{{{
# Deploy a module
code     app/code/local/My/Module

# Clear the cache
@shell   rm -rf ../../var/cache/* && echo "Cache cleared"
}}}

The shell command will run with *every* update, not just the first. As such it could also be used to copy files to a location within the root if for some reason symlinks did not get the job done.

{{{
# These file don't work when symlinked
@shell    rm -rf ../../lib/blah; cp -rf lib/blah ../../lib/blah
}}}
